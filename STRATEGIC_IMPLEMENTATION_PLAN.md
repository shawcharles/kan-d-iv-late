# Strategic Implementation Plan: KAN-D-IV-LATE Paper Enhancement

**Document**: Consolidated Strategic Plan for Paper Revision  
**Date**: July 4, 2025  
**Status**: **Revised - Pending Investigation**

## Executive Summary

This strategic plan consolidates findings from comprehensive statistical and code reviews to guide the enhancement of "Rethinking Distributional IVs: KAN-Powered D-IV-LATE & Model Choice." The paper addresses a novel and important research question, but recent simulation results have revealed **unexpected performance issues with the KAN-based estimator**, which now require immediate investigation.

**Current Status**: The initial implementation of asymptotic confidence intervals is complete. However, the first full simulation run has shown that **Random Forest currently outperforms KAN** in this setting, and the KAN model's confidence intervals exhibit poor coverage. Our immediate priority has shifted from paper enhancement to a focused investigation of the KAN model's performance and the reliability of its uncertainty estimates.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Initial Findings (COMPLETED ✅)

### 1.1 Code Standardization (COMPLETED ✅)
**Achievement**: Successfully standardized implementation across simulation and empirical studies.

**Completed Actions**:
- ✅ Unified KAN library usage (`efficient_kan` via `environment.yml`)
- ✅ Standardized hyperparameters via `kan_utils.py`
- ✅ Consistent cross-fitting (K=5) across all analyses
- ✅ Feature scaling integration
- ✅ Asymptotic standard errors implemented via `dlate_point_se`

### 1.2 Initial Simulation Results (COMPLETED ✅)
**Achievement**: Generated first set of results from the enhanced simulation framework.

**Key Findings**:
- **Unexpected KAN Underperformance**: Contrary to expectations, Random Forest shows lower bias (0.059 vs 0.135) and significantly lower RMSE (0.075 vs 0.151) than KAN in the current simulation setup.
- **Poor KAN CI Coverage**: The asymptotic 95% confidence intervals for KAN have very poor empirical coverage (47.6%), indicating the standard errors are unreliable in this context. RF coverage is better (81.8%) but still imperfect.
- **Computational Cost**: The simulation is computationally expensive, taking over 13 hours for 200 replications. This necessitates a more targeted approach to experimentation.

## Phase 2: KAN Performance Investigation (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)

### 2.1 Bootstrap Confidence Intervals (Next Step)
**Objective**: Obtain reliable confidence intervals for the KAN estimator.
**Rationale**: The poor coverage of asymptotic CIs is a critical issue. Bootstrapping provides a more robust (though computationally intensive) alternative for uncertainty quantification.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- [ ] Modify the main simulation loop in `kan_d_iv_late_simulation_enhanced.py` to use the existing `bootstrap_dlate_ci` function from `kan_utils.py`.
- [ ] Run a small number of bootstrap replications (e.g., `n_bootstrap=50`) on a single Monte Carlo replication to validate the implementation and estimate runtime.

### 2.2 Hyperparameter Tuning & Sensitivity Analysis
**Objective**: Determine if KAN's performance can be improved with different hyperparameters.
**Rationale**: The current KAN architecture may be suboptimal. A sensitivity analysis is required before concluding that RF is superior.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- [ ] **Targeted Grid Search**: Run short simulations (e.g., 20-30 replications) to test different values for:
    - `KAN_STEPS`: [50, 150, 250]
    - `KAN_HIDDEN_DIM`: [16, 48, 64]
    - `KAN_REG_STRENGTH`: [1e-3, 1e-5]
- [ ] **Analyze Trade-offs**: Evaluate the impact of these parameters on both RMSE and computational time.

### 2.3 DML Regularity Conditions Verification
**Objective**: Re-assess the theoretical underpinnings.
**Rationale**: The poor performance may stem from a violation of the Double Machine Learning regularity conditions (e.g., convergence rates).

**Implementation Strategy**:
- [ ] **Literature Review**: Re-read the sections of Chernozhukov et al. (2018) related to estimator properties.
- [ ] **Diagnostic Checks**: Design and implement diagnostic checks to assess properties like the Donsker class condition for the specific KAN architecture being used.

## Phase 3: Empirical Application & Paper Revision (ON HOLD)

This phase is on hold pending the results of the KAN performance investigation. The counterintuitive empirical results noted in the previous plan may be linked to the same underlying issues observed in the simulation.

### 3.1 Counterintuitive Empirical Results Analysis
- [ ] **Re-evaluate after KAN tuning**: Once an optimal KAN configuration is found, re-run the empirical application.

### 3.2 Manuscript and Figure Updates
- [ ] **Revise based on new findings**: The entire narrative of the paper may need to shift from "KAN is better" to a more nuanced discussion of model selection, computational trade-offs, and the challenges of applying complex models.

## Revised Implementation Timeline

### Immediate (1-2 weeks):
- **Bootstrap Validation**: Implement and test the bootstrap CI function on a small scale.
- **Targeted Hyperparameter Search**: Run a series of short simulations to find a better KAN configuration.

### Medium Term (2-4 weeks):
- **Full Bootstrap Simulation**: If a better KAN model is found, run a full simulation with bootstrap CIs (this may take several days).
- **Theoretical Diagnostics**: Investigate potential violations of DML conditions.

### Long Term (4+ weeks):
- **Re-run Empirical Analysis**: Use the best-performing model on the empirical data.
- **Revise and Rewrite Paper**: Adapt the paper's narrative and conclusions based on the new, more nuanced results.

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items:
1.  **KAN Performance Does Not Improve**: It's possible that even after tuning, KAN does not outperform RF in this setting.
    - **Mitigation**: Pivot the paper's focus to be about model selection challenges and the importance of not assuming a complex model is always better. This is a valuable contribution in itself.
2.  **Computational Constraints**: Bootstrapping is very slow. A full run could be infeasible.
    - **Mitigation**: Use a smaller number of bootstrap samples (e.g., 199) and leverage parallel processing if possible. Acknowledge the computational cost as a key finding.

## Conclusion (Revised)

The initial strategic plan was based on the assumption of KAN's superiority. The first full simulation has challenged this assumption, revealing critical issues with the KAN estimator's performance and uncertainty quantification.

This revised plan redirects our focus to a rigorous, evidence-based investigation of these issues. The immediate priority is to establish reliable confidence intervals via bootstrapping and to determine if KAN's performance can be salvaged through hyperparameter tuning. The project's timeline and narrative will be adapted based on the outcome of this investigation.
