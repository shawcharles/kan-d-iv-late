# Project Progress: KAN-D-IV-LATE Enhancement

## What Works / Completed

-   **Core Codebase:** A solid Python codebase exists for D-IV-LATE estimation, including:
    -   A data generation process for simulations.
    -   Modular functions for estimating nuisance components using both KANs and Random Forests.
    -   Implementations for both asymptotic and bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification.
    -   A full simulation script (`kan_d_iv_late_simulation_enhanced.py`) that compares the estimators.
-   **Initial Paper Draft:** A complete draft of the paper (`main.tex`) exists, articulating the initial research narrative.
-   **Strategic Plan:** A clear strategic plan (`STRATEGIC_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) has been formulated to address the unexpected initial findings.
-   **Investigation Workbook:** A Jupyter workbook (`kan_performance_investigation.ipynb`) has been created and subsequently debugged to ensure it runs correctly in a Google Colab environment by handling all necessary dependencies and file paths.
-   **Memory Bank:** The core documentation for the project has been established in the `memory-bank/` directory.

## What's Left to Build / To Do

1.  **Execute Investigation:** The primary pending task is for the user to run the `kan_performance_investigation.ipynb` workbook.
2.  **Analyze Investigation Results:** The CSV files generated by the workbook need to be analyzed to determine the KAN estimator's true performance and the reliability of its bootstrap confidence intervals.
3.  **Decide on Final Paper Narrative:** Based on the analysis, a final decision must be made between "Scenario A" (KAN is salvageable) and "Scenario B" (KAN is not superior).
4.  **Perform Final Computation (Conditional):** If "Scenario A" is chosen, one final, large-scale simulation run will be required using the optimized KAN configuration.
5.  **Revise the Paper:** The `main.tex` file needs a comprehensive revision to align its text, tables, figures, and conclusions with the final, evidence-based narrative. This includes:
    -   Updating the abstract and introduction.
    -   Revising the simulation section to present the new results.
    -   Potentially re-running the empirical application and updating that section.
    -   Rewriting the "Caveat Emptor" and conclusion sections to reflect the final findings.

## Current Status

The project is at a pivotal juncture. The initial phase of coding and drafting is complete. A critical issue (KAN underperformance) has been identified, and a clear plan and the necessary tools to investigate it are now in place.

**The project is currently paused, awaiting the results from the execution of the `kan_performance_investigation.ipynb` workbook.** The next steps are entirely dependent on the outcome of that investigation.
