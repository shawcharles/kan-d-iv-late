# Active Context: KAN Performance Investigation

## Current Work Focus

The immediate focus is on executing the `kan_performance_investigation.ipynb` Jupyter workbook. This workbook was created to systematically investigate and resolve the unexpected underperformance of the KAN-based D-IV-LATE estimator.

## Recent Changes and Decisions

1.  **Decision to Investigate:** Based on the `STRATEGIC_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, we have pivoted from directly revising the paper to first conducting a focused investigation into the KAN estimator's performance.
2.  **Creation of Investigation Workbook:** A new Jupyter workbook, `kan_performance_investigation.ipynb`, has been created in the `kan-d-iv-late-main/workbook/` directory. This is now the primary tool for the next phase of work.
3.  **Adoption of a Two-Part Investigation Strategy:** The workbook implements a clear, two-part strategy:
    *   **Part 1: Hyperparameter Tuning:** A fast grid search to find the optimal KAN hyperparameters.
    *   **Part 2: Bootstrap Analysis:** A limited bootstrap run using the best hyperparameters to check the reliability of confidence intervals.
4.  **Decision to Save All Results:** Per the user's request, the workbook is configured to save all numerical outputs from the investigation into CSV files (`hyperparameter_tuning_results.csv` and `bootstrap_analysis_results.csv`) in the `results/` directory for detailed analysis.
5.  **Colab Compatibility Fix:** The workbook was updated to include a setup cell that clones the project's GitHub repository. This resolves an initial `ModuleNotFoundError` and ensures the notebook can find the project's source files.
6.  **Dependency Installation Fix:** The setup cell in the workbook was further updated to include a `pip install` command for the `efficient-kan` library. This resolves the underlying dependency issue that was causing the import of `kan_utils` to fail.

## Next Steps

1.  **Execute the Updated Jupyter Workbook:** The user will run the revised `kan_performance_investigation.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2.  **Analyze the Results:** Once the execution is complete and the result CSVs are generated, the next step is to analyze the output to determine which of the two scenarios (A or B from the `projectbrief.md`) has occurred.
3.  **Make a Final Narrative Decision:** Based on the analysis, a final decision will be made on the paper's central thesis.
4.  **Revise the Paper:** The final step will be to perform a comprehensive revision of the `main.tex` file to align its narrative, results, and conclusions with the findings from the investigation.

## Key Learnings and Insights

-   The initial assumption of KAN's superiority was premature. This highlights the importance of rigorous, empirical validation of new methods before building a research narrative around them.
-   A structured investigation plan is crucial when unexpected results occur. The `STRATEGIC_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` provided the blueprint for the current focused approach.
-   Modular code design (as seen in `kan_utils.py`) is highly beneficial, as it allows for the easy adaptation of existing logic into new experimental setups like the investigation workbook.
